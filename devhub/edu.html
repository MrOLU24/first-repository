        <h1>FOUR YEARS OF PROFESSOR EGWUNYENGA AT DELSUBY BEN NWANNE</h1>
        <p>Four years in the saddle as the Vice-Chancellor of Delta State University,
            Abraka, (DELSU), Professor Andy Egwunyenga has amply demonstrated to be
            a confluence for justice, hard work, propriety, discipline and due process. His
            initial pledge to redress genuine cases of injustice still resonates with the
            University till this day.
            On his first working day in office, Monday, December 2, as the 7th substantive
            Vice-Chancellor among others, he made a clarion call through a special edition
            of the DELSU Bulletin to the academic community to “unite as a community
            of scholars and administrators to collectively lift up Delta State University.”
            “In that momentous ice breaking communication, the new Vice-Chancellor
            declared.” I solemnly pledge to lead, inspire and advance the repositioning
            of Delta State University to emerge as the best State University in Nigeria. To
            realize this vision, we have a lot of work to do!”
            In the past 48 months, Professor Egwunyenga has irrevocably been
            committed to the transformation of the University in different spheres, using
            his six-point agenda of building an effective and motivated work force, pursuit
            of innovation using ICT, strengthening faculties, departments and units emphasis on the welfare of students,
            improvement of the revenue base and
            applying a new approach to University administration has provided a road
            map for the people-centered administration to post massive achievements,
            despite its lean resources.
            Indeed, appreciating the people-factor early in his administration has been a
            success factor as no leader can do everything all by himself. He therefore
            embarked on bringing back to the fold those who had been frustrated and
            alienated from the system, due to various forms of injustice meted out to
            them. He provided an explanation in a recent Lead Interview published in the
            DELSU News of April 2022. “We have affected the lives of staff who were depressed by the grievances of either victimization or injustice or things that
            happened against management of people,” he said. “So we have healed
            wounds, we have united staff and we have attempted to get everybody on
            board.”
            If we were to borrow from the discipline of advertising, it is reasonable to
            state that the ‘unique selling point’ of the Professor Egwunyenga
            administration is his anchor on people, the ‘ant mentality’ which leverages on
            the power of a group to achieve its aims and objectives. “I think that the
            vision that I came with and the mission to advance the position of the
            University has, in fact, been taken over by staff without pushing or forcing
            them to do what is required,” he declared in the same edition of the same
            magazine.
            Professor Egwunyenga’s power of persuasion, credibility, and get-thingsdone disposition has worked wonderfully for him. He is not an arm-chair
            administrator who dreads the scorching sun! On the contrary, he is always
            out there in the field to see things for him, making observations, suggestions
            and where necessary, giving instructions and directives and insisting that they
            are carried out. He always goes for on-the-spot assessments of projects.
            Some of the many projects he has delivered included beautification,
            renovation and landscaping of Site II and Site III Main Entrance gates, ongoing
            construction and furnishing of offices and lecture theatres for the
            Department of Nursing, Abraka, Faculty of Pharmacy Complex, Construction
            of Educational Technology Laboratory, on-going maintenance project of the
            1000 capacity and 750 (A, B and C) lecture halls in Abraka and also the very
            huge edifice of Faculty of Management Sciences, funded from internally
            generated revenue. Other projects, funded by TETFUND and Delta State
            Government, are nearing completion as the University helmsman has assured
            that all would be delivered before leaving office on November 30, 2024.
            One of the bold steps taken by the administration was the conversion of nonteaching staff to academic staff. It instantly became a source of motivation</p>
            <p>for many who had worked hard to improve their academic qualifications with
                the hope of joining the academia. It was a win-win for the parties involved as
                it addressed, in a creative and realistic manner, the high under-staffing among
                the academic staff. The strengthening of academic staff definitely has a
                salutary effect on staff –student ratio which is abysmally poor in Nigeria. It is
                thought also to increase the University’s citations as more academics are
                involved in research, thereby improving the University’s rankings which have
                been on the upswing in the past four years.
                Indeed, DELSU under Professor Egwunyenga administration has made
                tremendous progress in this regard. Addressing a Press Conference in April
                2023 during the last Convocation, Professor Egwunyenga informed the
                audience, thus:“In the latest global ranking of Universities by Alper –Doger
                Scientific Index, Delta State University was ranked as the 27th best University
                in Nigeria among the over 200 Universities in the country and the 4th best
                among State Government-owned Universities. Further analysis of the ranking
                showed the University to the best State University in the South-South and
                South Eastern parts of Nigeria.
                “Furthermore, another highly recognized global Universities ranking body,
                Webometrics, in their own latest rankings, placed the University as 194th out
                of 2087 Universities in Africa and 24th out of over 200 universities in Nigeria,
                based on verified Google Scholar citations. According to the ranking, Delta
                State University recorded 56,443 citations, beating some highly rated
                Universities in United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Sweden,
                Turkey, Portugal, Canada and some other more advanced Countries. This
                again is consistent with the Alper-Doger Scientific Index ranking that earlier
                placed the University as the 27th best in the Country.” This is not particularly
                surprising, given the expansion of academic programmes as over 87
                programmes including Medicine and Surgery with an increase to 120
                admission quota, have been given full accreditation status by the National
                Universities Commission The Professor of Parasitology and Public Health is leaving no stone unturned
                in developing DELSU, growing the population from about 19,000 to over
                35,000 and giving all segments of the University community a sense of
                belonging. The women folk have particularly benefited from his broadmindedness which has seen a phenomenal growth of women at the
                commending height of the administration, rising from just one woman among
                the seven Principal Officers of the University to a whooping four! His
                argument for gender balance is excitingly persuasive. “Any society that does
                not harness the potentials of women is operating less than 50 percent
                capacity. By so doing, you have removed the other half, which is a kind of
                discrimination. It is wrong to look down on any one because of gender.”
                In fact, in order to properly internalize and domesticate the ideals of gender
                balancing, the University is strengthening its Directorate of Gender and
                Development Studies which recently held a successful seminar for Directors
                of Gender Studies in Nigerian Universities. Also put in place are several
                policies to educate and inform the University Community on the proper and
                acceptable manner of conduct in different areas of human endeavours and
                also to reduce human subjectivity in interpreting issues. To this end, the
                University has, in the period under review, ‘enacted’ the gender policy,
                sexual harassment policy, plagiarism policy, safety policy, copyright policy and
                research and innovation policy.
                According to the good book – the Bible- no one should light a candle and put
                it under the bed, hence the activities of the Professor Egwunyenga
                administration have been in the public domain, with encouraging reactions.
                It is amazing that his credibility rating from the very first day in office has to
                this day remained encouragingly high. As Editor-in-chief of DELSU News, this
                writer had commented on his performance and the inflow of awards and
                recognitions for the University and its chief executive officer in these words:
                “Given the transparency, high standard in scholarship, prudence and
                adherence to due process by the Professor Egwunyenga leadership, many
                persons in the country, and outside, are watching and applauding. Within the
                5
                past 18 months awards, commendations and honourable mention have come
                the way of the Professor of Parasitology and Public Health’’. It is germane to
                mention a few of such awards to include: PAN African Prize for Excellence,
                Global Hope and Justice Award of Excellence, Association of Vice-Chancellors
                of Nigeria Universities (AVCNU) Award of Recognition for Contribution to
                Development of the Eaglespan Plagiarism detection software, Award of
                Excellence as one of the 10 Most Outstanding Vice-Chancellors in Nigeria by
                Vanguard Press, Environmental sustainability Award by the Senior Staff
                Association of Nigerian Universities, SSANU, DELSU Branch and recently, the
                Grand Patron of Student’s Union of Delta State University, Abraka. The new
                President of the Students Union, Mr. Mathias Jimson, in a recent interview
                praised the Vice-Chancellor for “his diplomatic nature and his willingness to
                engage with the Union peacefully.”
